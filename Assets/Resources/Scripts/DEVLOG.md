  How to design a game:

         What kind of PLAYER EXPERIENCE do you want to create?
                    curuiuysity n whimsy

           What gamedev skills do you know so far
           changing color
           2d movemment across 4 direcyions
           collision

           need:
           title screen, end screen
           particles / color gradients
           sound effects
           localized sound
           animation
           

        
             Design something that creates the Player Experience you want with the Skills you have

                  //Start with User Experience flow chart DONE

                
                           
                       Thing to make 1 -> a. character in 4 directions with floaty movement  DONE! 

                       new problem: make diagonal movement

                          b. character gameobject. :3

                          c. floaty physics  1.  learning how to do physics (its with velocity) :3



                       -> a.  make map bigger than camera Est. 1 hours

                                b.  set up main camera. Estimate time and Multiply by 2

                                c. big map and have camera track  

                                2.  practice the camera track

                                3.   Implement the tracking camera

                                        
                        Thing to make 3 -> a.  make temp flower that can be activated and deactivated. Est. 3 hours


                                b.  create game object. Estimate time and Multiply by 2

                                c.set up trigger that goes on and off with collision  1.  to learn triggers





2:02 pm (been working since 1:00)
making a new character move wasnt too bad but i have so idea how to retain its momentum over time

devlog 2:19 pm i misplaced the first one, anyway im struggling with the velocity

2:28 fixed it! i had to add it to the parent in the inspector

2:45 got the diagonal movement! only issue is you can't undiagonal once it starts


DONE
// Making GO move triangle move method DONE
// Transform DONE
// make it change direction when it hits wall DONE
// make chart DONE + explanation 
















Statements:
assignment- assigning a value to a variable
conditional - ' The room is big' "is" is what makes it conditional 
Conditional statements resolve to a bool.
Method:
States: 
Classes:


Struct is like a method, like a class
holds a lot of information


C# keywords:
if - the word that resolves conditionals to a bool (true false stuff) after a conditional statement

I am cool. ( me == cool)
I am cooler than Haider. ( Me > Haider) 
Me and Haider must be same type of variable

(Me == cool && Haider == cool) if both things are true, it resolves to a bool
(Me == cool || Haider || == cool || Class == cool || Games == cool) -- if any of these statements are true, the bool goes through

my.position.x is read as a float

Access returntype    name of method   Parameters
public int           Adding          (intx, inty)


public int Adding(int x, int y)
{
    int a = x + y;
    return a;
}


Class Example
{
    public void Adding(int x, int y)
    {
        int a = x + y;
        return a;
    }
    AnotherMethod()  //the () is for parameters
    {
        int b = Adding(3,2)
        print (b);
    }
}
